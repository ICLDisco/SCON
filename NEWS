===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of SCON begining with
version 1.0.

As more fully described in the "Software Version Number" section in
the README file, SCON typically maintains two separate version
series simultaneously - the current release and one that is locked
to only bug fixes.  Since these series are semi-independent of each
other, a single NEWS-worthy item might apply to different series. For
example, a bug might be fixed in the master, and then moved to the
current release as well as the "stable" bug fix release branch.
